  <h2><b>Bee Movie Script : (Scene 1) </b></h2>
  <p> According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. 
      Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. 
      Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. 
      Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. 
      I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. 
      - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. 
      Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. 
      You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. 
      Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. 
      - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. 
      And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. 
      Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. 
      Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! 
      - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? 
      - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. 
      But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? 
      You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What's the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? 
      That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. 
      You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! 
      - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. 
      Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. 
      Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! 
      He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. 
      - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. </p>

<h3><b>Shrek Movie Script (Scene 1): </b></h3>
<p> {Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.
    But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only 
    be broken by love's first kiss.
    She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing 
    dragon.
    Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, 
    but non prevailed.
    She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest 
    tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.
    {Laughing} 
    Like that's ever gonna happen.
    {Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}
    What a load of - 
    Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
    I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
    She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
    In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
    The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
    Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
    So much to do so much to see
    So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets
    You'll never know if you don't go
    You'll never shine if you don't glow
    Hey, now You're an all-star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey, now You're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold
    It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
    You're bundled up now but wait till you get older
    But the meteor men beg to differ
    Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
    The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
    The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
    My world's on fire
    How 'bout yours
    That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
    Hey, now, you're an all-star
    {Shouting}
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey, now You're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold
    {Belches}
    Go!
    Go!
    {Record Scratching}
    Go. Go.Go.
    Hey, now, you're an all-star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey, now You're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold
    -Think it's in there?
    -All right. Let's get it!
    -Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?
    -Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.
    {Laughs}
    -Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint.
    Now, ogres - - They're much worse.
    They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.
    -No!
    -They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!
    Actually, it's quite good on toast.
    -Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!
    {Gasping}
    -Right.
    {Roaring}
    {Shouting}
    {Roaring}
    {Whispers} This is the part where you run away.
    {Gasping}
    {Laughs}
    {Laughing} And stay out!
    "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."
    {Sighs}</p>

  <h3><b>Corrupted Vor's Speech: </b></h3>
  <p> Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure. Tenno use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void. I was cut in half, destroyed, but through its Janus Key, the Void called to me. It brought me here and here I was reborn. 
      We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. 
      Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. 
      They will learn its simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this place of their impurity.</p>

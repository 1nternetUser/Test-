	    <dt><b><u>Sun Tzu | Art of War: December 2, 2018</b></u></dt>
	    <dd><b>Chapter 1:</b> The Art of War is a matter of <i>Life and Death</i> to the State that must not be ignored.
		<br>There are 5 factors to consider in one's army: 
		<br>(1)<i> &emsp; The Moral Law</i>, the law in which causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.
		<br>(2)<i> &emsp; Heaven</i>, the importance of night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.
		<br>(3)<i> &emsp; Earth</i>, the comprise of distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.
		<br>(4)<i> &emsp; The Commander</i>, the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.
		<br>(5)<i> &emsp; Method and Discipline</i>, the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.
		<br>
		<br>When seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:—
		<br>(1) &emsp; Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the <i>Moral law</i>?
		<br>(2) &emsp; Which of the two generals has most ability?
		<br>(3) &emsp; With whom lie the advantages derived from <i>Heaven</i> and <i>Earth</i>?
		<br>(4) &emsp; On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
		<br>(5) &emsp; Which army is stronger?
		<br>(6) &emsp; On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
		<br>(7) &emsp; In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?
		<br>
		<br> &emsp; Take advantage to any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules;
		<br>Depending whether the situations are favorable, one should modify one’s plans if things don't go as it should.
		<br>All warfare is based on deception; hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable to; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.
		<br>If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is easy to anger, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be known to the enemy beforehand.
		<br>Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.

		<br><b>Chapter 2:</b> In the operations of war where your enemy can possess many soldiers and firepower, so will the cost in raising these soldiers.
		<br>When engaging in a fight, if a victory is long in coming, then your men’s weapons will grow dull and their spirits will weaken. 
		If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength and resources. Again, if the campaign is prolonged, the resources of the State will not be equal to its strains; you will lose more than what you're fighting for. 
		If your weapons are dulled, your spirits are low, your strength is exhausted and your treasure is spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avoid the consequences that's about to come.
		<br>We are aware of 'stupid haste' in wars, yet long delays is never thought of cleverness. There's no country that benefits from a prolonged war. The only exception are those well acquainted with the evils of war that can only understand the profitable way of carrying it on.
		The skillful soldier does not raise reinforcements, neither are his supplies loaded more than twice. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus, the army will have food enough for its needs.
		Poverty of the State exchequer (system that manages its resources) causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people’s substance to be drained away. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.
		With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen, and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.
		Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy’s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one’s own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one’s own store.
		Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.
		Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.
		This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one’s own strength. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.
		Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people’s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.
